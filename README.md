# Web of Scholars :mortar_board:

## Purpose
I made this so I could see the relationships between scholars that I had been looking up. An interesting byproduct of this web is that 
you get to see which scholar influenced others. 
## Notes
should this be a lookup where you search someone and then you see their tree?
maybe it should be a tool for people on wikipedia to see which important links need more information
  - this will obviously take a while but I think it would be cool to be able to see that someones doctoral student doesn't have a lot of info and fill it in
